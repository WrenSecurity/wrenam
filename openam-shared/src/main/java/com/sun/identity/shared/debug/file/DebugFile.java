/**
 * <p>
 * The implementation of this interface as well as the
 * <code>com.sun.identity.shared.debug.file.DebugFileProvider</code> interface together
 * provide the necessary functionality to replace or enhance the Debug File service.
 * <p/>
 * Because of specific features that are only related to the log file and not the debugger,
 * the debugger and the log file management can't be manage in a same class.
 * For example, two debugger could write on the same log file with the merge mapping.
 * They could have a different debug level but should have the same log rotation.
 * This interface manages the log rotation, and the debugger the log level.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * Even if this interface was dedicated to debugger, it could be used for managing a
 * different kind of log file (example : access, statistics, etc.).
 * <p/>
 * Every features that are related to the file should be implemented by classes that
 * implement this interface.
