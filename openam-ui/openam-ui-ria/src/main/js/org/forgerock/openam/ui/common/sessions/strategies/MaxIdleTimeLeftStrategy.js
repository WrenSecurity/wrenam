/**
 * Maximum Idle Time vs Session Time Left Strategy.
 * <p/>
 * Supports both stateful and stateless sessions.
 * <p/>
 * This strategy utilises the fact that all calls to the server's <code>session</code> end-point will respond with
 * <code>401</code> if the current session has expired, while the response payload will help to decide when to
 * next perform a validation if the session is still valid.
 * <p/>
 * Subsequent calls to <code>getTimeLeft</code> are used to check if the idle timeout has been reached. The number of
 * seconds until the idle timeout is used to determine the next best time to check the session.
 *
